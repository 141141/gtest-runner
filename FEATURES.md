# Gtest-runner

![](resources/screenshots/screen.png)

A Qt5 based automated test-runner and Graphical User Interface for Google Test unit tests

## Automatic test running

![Automatic test running](resources/screenshots/feature0.png)

- Gtest-runner uses file system watchers do detect every time your test has changed (e.g. when you build it), and automatically re-runs the test and updates all the test case windows. This feature even works if you rebuild your test when gtest-runner is closed.
- Gtest-runner runs all of your tests in parallel, showing a progress indicator for each one.
- _Note:_ for expensive or lengthy tests, automatic test running can be disabled by unchecking the box next to the test name.

## Simple traffic-light output

![Traffic light](resources/screenshots/trafficlight.png)

- <img src="resources/images/green.png" height=20 align="center"/> - A green light means that the test was run and all test cases passed with no errors.
- <img src="resources/images/yellow.png" height=20 align="center"/> - A yellow light means that the test has changed on disc and needs to be re-run. If your test executable is corrupted, deadlocks, or segfaults, you may see a test in a "hung" yellow state.
- <img src="resources/images/red.png" height=20 align="center"/> - A red light means that the test executable failed at least one test case. 
- <img src="resources/images/gray.png" height=20 align="center"/> - A gray light indicates that the test is disabled, _or_ if autorun is disabled it can also indicate that test output is out-of-date.

## Full console output

![console](resources/screenshots/console.png)

- All gtest console output is reatined (including syntax highlighting) and piped to the built-in console dock, so you get all the benefits of a GUI without losing any of your debugging output. Plus, `gtest-runner` adds additional capabilities like a [search dialog](#search-failures) and [forward and backward failure navigation buttons](#nextprevious-failure).

## Fully customizable layout

![tab](resources/screenshots/tab.png)

- Gtest-runner uses detachable docks for the test executable, failure, and conosle docks, so you can tab, rearrange, detach, or hide them to best suite your screen layout.

## Light and dark themes

![light theme](resources/screenshots/theme.png) ![dark theme](resources/screenshots/theme2.png)

- Easily switch between your system's default color theme or a breeze-inspired dark theme.

## System notifications

![System Notification](resources/screenshots/systemNotification.png)

- When a test is autorun in the background, gtest-runner will generate a system notification letting you know if any tests failed. Notifications can also (optionally) be configured for tests which pass during autorun.
- _Note:_ notifications aren't generated for tests which are run manually (since you are presumably already looking at the output).

## Gtest support

- Gtest-runner supports both `gtest-1.7.0` and `gtest-1.8.0` style output.

# Test Executable dock

## Drag-and-drop

- To add a test executable to watch, simply drag-and-drop the file anywhere on the `gtest-runner` GUI.

## Easily add and remove tests

![Add/remove](resources/screenshots/addremove.png)

- In addition to drag-and-drop, it's easy to add or remove a test using the right-click context menu in the `Test Executable` window.

## Re-run test

![Re-run test](resources/screenshots/run.png)

- You can manually re-run a test at any time by right-clicking on it and selecting `Run Test...`

## Kill test

![Kill test](resources/screenshots/kill.png)

- Did you just actually click run on your 4-hour CPU intensive test? No problem! Cancel a test at any time by right-clicking on it, and selecting `Kill Test...`.
- _Hint:_ if the `Kill Test...` option is grayed out, that means your test isn't running (even if it has a yellow indicator).

## gtest command line options

![gtest command line](resources/screenshots/commandLine.png)

- Clicking on the hamburger menu to the left of the test executable name will pop up the `gtest command line` dialogue, allowing access to all of the options you'd have if you ran your test directly from a terminal.

## Enable/disable autorun

![disable autorun](resources/screenshots/disableAutorun.png)

- Compiling frequently, or have a resource-intensive test that you don't want running in the background? Whatever the reason, it's simple to disable autorun by un-checking the autorun box next to the test executable name.

## Test progress

![Progress](resources/screenshots/progress.png)

- Each running test displays a progress bar indicator. Measured progress is based on the number of tests completed out of the overall number of tests, not time-to-go.

## Test path tooltips

![Path](resources/screenshots/path.png)

- Mousing over any of the test executables will show the full path to the test as a tooltip. This can be useful for disambiguating multiple tests with the same name. On Windows, `Debug` and `Release` builds
